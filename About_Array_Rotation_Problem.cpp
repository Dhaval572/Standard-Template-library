Explaination of problem:

	Array Rotation refers to the process of shifting the elements of an array by a certain number of positions either to the left or to the right.

	There are two type of rotation 1). left rotation and 2). right rotation.

	Example of right rotation:
	
		Input array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		Rotate by k = 2 positions:

		1). After the first right rotation: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
		2). After the second right rotation: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
		
		The final array after 2 right rotations is [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].

	Example of left rotation:

		Input array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

		1). After the first left rotation: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
		2). After the second left rotation: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
		
		After the second left rotation: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

	Practical Applications of Array Rotation:

	1). Circular Queues:

		In many data structures like circular buffers or queues, elements can be 
		rotated to simulate continuous data flow.

	2). Image Processing:

		Rotating an image (represented as a matrix or an array) by a certain angle 
		can be thought of as rotating the pixels.

	3).	Game Development:

		Arrays may be rotated to represent movements, such as rotating a characterâ€™s direction or rotating objects in a 2D game world.

	So, this was only problem explaination of Rotation.

	I hope you understand everything!
