About vector:

	vector in a container like array but is is resizable.

	It represents a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size, allowing for efficient random access and modification of its elements.

Features of vector:

1. Dynamic Size: 

   -> Automatically grows or shrinks as elements are added or removed.

2. Random Access: 

   -> Allows accessing elements using an index, like an array.

3. Automatic Memory Management: 

   -> Handles memory allocation and deallocation automatically.

4. Versatile Data Storage: 

   -> Can store various data types (basic types, classes, etc.).

5. Easy Element Manipulation: 

   -> Supports adding, removing, and inserting elements.

6. Size and Capacity: 

   -> Methods to check current size (size()) and capacity (capacity()).

7. Iterators: 

   -> Provides iterators for easy traversal of elements.
   ( Note : iterator is like a pointer but it is not pointer it points to the object )
